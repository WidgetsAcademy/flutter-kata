This is a small kata to practice building your own interactive elements

We will be building two different buttons:

## A button that changes color while you tap it

![Gesture Detector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WidgetsAcademy/flutter-kata/main/f003_custom_buttons/gesture-detector.gif)

hint: use a StatefulWidget to keep track of the tapped state and a GestureDetector to detect taps

## A button that has a splash effect when you tap it

![Inkwell ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WidgetsAcademy/flutter-kata/main/f003_custom_buttons/inkwell.gif)

hint: This can be a StatelessWidget with an InkWell - you may need to clip the Inkwell to the shape of the button.
